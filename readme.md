# Emotion classification based on text

## Introduction
This project is an attempt to learn AI and deep learning concepts. The code is not written in a professional way and was mostly generated by AI. However, it can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring AI like me.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:
[Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/emotion-dataset)

## Model Details
- Model Used: Defined as `model` in the code.
- Training Accuracy: 99%.
- Validation Accuracy: 97%.

## Features
- Classifies images based on different human emotions ((joy,anger,fear)).
- Uses deep learning techniques for emotion detection.
- Trained on a labeled dataset of facial expressions.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different architectures and fine-tuning techniques.
- Improve dataset preprocessing for better classification results.


## Conclusion
This project is a simple AI experiment and should not be used in production. However, it can serve as a stepping stone for those learning about AI and emotion classification. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
